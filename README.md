# Projects-C-
This repository is a collection of mini-projects written in C++.
My intention with this repo is to learn more about OOP in C++ and show my skills to anyone interested in my work/skills.

## Description of each mini-project
**Task1**---->Program that calculates the energy released by an electronic transition in an hidrogen-like atom.<br />
The program has an interface to interact with.<br />
Skills: Functional programming, conditional, loops, inputs and outputs.<br />
<br />
**Task2**---->Program that calculates some statistics from a set of points located on an external file.<br />
The program has an interface to interact with and can recognize errors in the input files.<br />
Skills: Task1 + read from files.<br />
<br />
**Task3**---->Program that has an interface to store data in vectors.<br />
The program has an interface to interact with and can recognize errors in the user inputs.<br />
Skills: Task1 + iterators.<br />
<br />
**Task4**---->Program that shows an example of the basic structure of a class.<br />
The main program shows how to interact with instances of our previously defined class.<br />
Our class defines objects of type "galaxy" with properties as mass and luminosity. We have defined as well methods to constuct, modify and print the data on our galaxy instances.<br />
Skills: OOP(Class definition, default and parametrized constructor, methods)+Usage of objects in main program.<br />
<br />
**Task5**---->Program that defines a more complex class and some more advanced concepts of OOP.<br />
This program defines a class for complex numbers. It makes use of the overloading operators and friend functions concepts.<br />
Our class defines objects of type "complex" with real and imaginary parts. We have defined methods to constuct, destruct, modify and print the data on our complex numbers. We also overload operators as the sum and multiplication to use them between instances of the class.<br />
Skills: Task4 + Operators overloading + friend functions.<br />
<br />
**Task6**---->Program that defines a class for matrices and vectors.<br />
This program defines a class for matrices of arbitrary number of rows and columns. It includes vectors as a derived class.<br />
All the algebraic operations between vectors and matrices have been defined.<br />
All the common operations between the matrices have been defined, including transposing and the determinant of an square matrix.<br />
Furhter concepts of OPP as copy/move constructors and inheritance have been used in this program.<br />
Skills: Task4/5 + Copy/Move constructors + Inheritance + double pointers.<br />
